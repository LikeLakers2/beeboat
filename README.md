# beeboat
A bot that joins servers, creates the #bee-movie-script channel, posts the Bee Movie script to #bee-movie-script, then leaves.



In case you decide to run this yourself:

finished_servers.txt - a line-separated list of servers that have been finished.

ignored_servers.txt - a line-separated list of servers that are ignored. Useful for home servers.

unfinished_servers.json - a JSON data set for servers that are still in the process of having the script sent to them.

script.txt - Where the script that is sent is stored. Check the Tools directory for a script that will automatically split the messages every 2000 characters.
